# API reference

During API development, I use `Postman` for handling/testing all endpoints.

- Postman collection/documentation is available on this link [click here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/28708948/2sA2r53QcQ)
- Base URL endpoints: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` or `http://localhost:8000/`
